## The Little Game for Halloween

Hi everyone!&#128075; This is a little Halloween game that I started doing last year, but then I forgot about it a bit. But my friend Yanina insisted that I complete it&#128522; The Halloween mood is still in the air, so I'm not completely late with the game posting.

The game is not very difficult, I have not yet been able to solve some problems, but it works&#128517;

### What has been implemented:

* &#9989; Creation and movement of enemies
* &#9989; Movement of the player's picture when pressing the up and down keys
* &#9989; Saving the player's name and score in localStorage
* &#9989; Musical accompaniment with the ability to pause the music
* &#9989; Scoring and game levels

The game is implemented in **html, css and vanilla js**.
